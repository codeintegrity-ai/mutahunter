### Vulnerable Code Areas
**File:** `app.go`  
**Location:** Multiple functions  
**Description:** The following areas are vulnerable due to surviving mutants:
1. **`welcomeHandler`**: The response key was altered from "message" to "msg", indicating a lack of strict key validation in tests.
2. **`currentDateHandler`**: The response structure was changed to omit the "date" key, highlighting insufficient checks on response formats.
3. **`divideHandler`**: The condition for division by zero was modified to allow division by zero, which could lead to runtime errors.
4. **`sqrtHandler`**: The condition for negative numbers was weakened, allowing invalid inputs.
5. **`daysUntilNewYearHandler`**: An off-by-one error was introduced, indicating a lack of thorough validation in date calculations.
6. **`reverse`**: The loop condition was altered to create an infinite loop, showcasing potential flaws in logic handling.

### Test Case Gaps
**File:** `app_test.go`  
**Location:** Various test methods  
**Reason:** Existing tests likely do not cover:
1. Response structure validation, leading to undetected key changes.
2. Edge cases for division and square root operations, such as zero and negative inputs.
3. Logical errors in date calculations, which require comprehensive boundary testing.
4. Infinite loop scenarios that could arise from incorrect loop conditions.

### Improvement Recommendations
**New Test Cases Needed:**
1. **Test Method:** `testWelcomeHandlerResponseStructure`
   - **Description:** Validate that the response contains the correct key ("message") and value.
2. **Test Method:** `testCurrentDateHandlerResponse`
   - **Description:** Ensure the response includes the "date" key with a valid date format.
3. **Test Method:** `testDivideByZero`
   - **Description:** Test division by zero to confirm proper error handling.
4. **Test Method:** `testSqrtNegativeInput`
   - **Description:** Check the response when a negative number is passed to the square root function.
5. **Test Method:** `testDaysUntilNewYearCalculation`
   - **Description:** Validate the calculation of days until New Year, ensuring no off-by-one errors.
6. **Test Method:** `testReverseFunctionInfiniteLoop`
   - **Description:** Test the reverse function with various inputs to ensure it does not enter an infinite loop.
