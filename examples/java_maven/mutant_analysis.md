### Vulnerable Code Areas
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/BankAccount.java`  
**Location:** Lines 28, 36, 56, 66  
**Description:** The methods `deposit`, `withdraw`, `executeBatchTransactions`, and `scheduleTransaction` contain vulnerabilities due to improper handling of negative values and null checks. Specifically, allowing negative deposits and withdrawals can lead to incorrect balance updates, while the lack of null checks for transaction arrays can cause `NullPointerExceptions`.

### Test Case Gaps
**File:** `src/test/java/com/example/BankAccountTest.java`  
**Location:** Various test methods  
**Reason:** Existing test cases do not account for edge cases involving negative amounts for deposits and withdrawals. Additionally, there are no tests to verify the behavior of the system when null arrays are passed to `executeBatchTransactions`, nor do they check for scheduling transactions with non-positive days.

### Improvement Recommendations
**New Test Cases Needed:**
1. **Test Method:** `testDepositNegativeAmount`
   - **Description:** Verify that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when attempting to deposit a negative amount.
   
2. **Test Method:** `testWithdrawNegativeAmount`
   - **Description:** Ensure that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when attempting to withdraw a negative amount.
   
3. **Test Method:** `testExecuteBatchTransactionsWithNull`
   - **Description:** Test the behavior of `executeBatchTransactions` when null arrays are passed for deposits and withdrawals, ensuring proper exception handling.
   
4. **Test Method:** `testScheduleTransactionWithNegativeDays`
   - **Description:** Confirm that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when scheduling a transaction with negative days.

By implementing these test cases, the code's robustness can be significantly improved, ensuring that it properly handles edge cases and maintains integrity in transaction processing.
