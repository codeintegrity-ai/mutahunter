### Vulnerable Code Areas
**File:** `app.py`  
**Location:** Multiple endpoints  
**Description:** The surviving mutants indicate vulnerabilities in the following areas:
1. **Current Date Endpoint:** Returns an incorrect date format, which could mislead users relying on accurate date information.
2. **Division Endpoint:** The condition allowing division by zero has been altered, potentially leading to runtime errors.
3. **Square Root Endpoint:** The condition for negative numbers has been modified, allowing invalid inputs that could result in incorrect outputs.
4. **Days Until New Year Calculation:** An off-by-one error has been introduced, leading to inaccurate day counts.
5. **Future Date Calculation:** An invalid future date is used, which could cause runtime exceptions.

### Test Case Gaps
**File:** `app.py`  
**Location:** Various endpoints  
**Reason:** Existing test cases likely do not cover:
1. Edge cases for date formats and invalid date scenarios.
2. Division by zero and negative number handling in mathematical operations.
3. Boundary conditions for date calculations, particularly around New Year.

### Improvement Recommendations
**New Test Cases Needed:**
1. **Test Method:** `testCurrentDateInvalidFormat`
   - **Description:** Verify that the current date endpoint returns a valid ISO date format.
2. **Test Method:** `testDivideByZero`
   - **Description:** Ensure that dividing by zero raises the appropriate HTTP exception.
3. **Test Method:** `testSquareRootNegative`
   - **Description:** Confirm that attempting to calculate the square root of a negative number raises an HTTP exception.
4. **Test Method:** `testDaysUntilNewYearOffByOne`
   - **Description:** Validate the calculation of days until New Year to ensure it is accurate.
5. **Test Method:** `testFutureDateInvalid`
   - **Description:** Check that the endpoint handling future dates does not lead to runtime exceptions and returns valid results.

By addressing these gaps, the robustness of the application can be significantly improved, ensuring that edge cases and potential errors are effectively managed.
