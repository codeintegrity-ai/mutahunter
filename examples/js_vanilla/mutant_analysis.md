### Vulnerable Code Areas
**File:** `ui.js`  
**Location:** `showProfile` method (Line 7) and `showRepos` method (Line 45)  
**Description:** The code is vulnerable to incorrect data display due to reliance on specific keys in the user and repository objects. The omission of the `avatar_url` key and the typo in `forms_count` (should be `forks_count`) can lead to incomplete or misleading user profiles and repository information.

### Test Case Gaps
**File:** `ui.js`  
**Location:** Test cases for `showProfile` and `showRepos` methods  
**Reason:** Existing test cases likely do not validate the presence and correctness of all expected keys in the user and repository objects. Specifically, they may not check for the existence of `avatar_url` or validate that the correct keys are used for displaying repository data, such as `forks_count`.

### Improvement Recommendations
**New Test Cases Needed:**
1. **Test Method:** `testShowProfileWithMissingAvatar`
   - **Description:** Add a test case to verify that the profile display handles the absence of the `avatar_url` key gracefully, ensuring that the UI does not break and provides appropriate feedback.
   
2. **Test Method:** `testShowReposWithIncorrectKey`
   - **Description:** Implement a test case to check the behavior when the `forms_count` key is used instead of `forks_count`, ensuring that the UI correctly identifies and handles this discrepancy.

3. **Test Method:** `testShowProfileWithAllKeys`
   - **Description:** Create a test case that validates the complete structure of the user object, ensuring all expected keys are present and correctly rendered in the UI.

By addressing these gaps, the robustness of the UI code can be significantly improved, ensuring that it handles unexpected data structures more effectively.
