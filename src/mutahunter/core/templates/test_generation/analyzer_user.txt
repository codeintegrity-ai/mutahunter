# Test Plan Generation for {{ source_file_name }}
## Source File
Below is the source file for which you will write tests. Line numbers are added for reference only.
```{{ language }}
{{ source_file_numbered }}
```

{% if lines_to_cover %}
## Uncovered Lines
Generate tests to cover these line numbers:
{{ lines_to_cover }}
{% endif %}

## Existing Test Suite ({{ test_file_name }})
Analyze this file to understand existing tests, structure, and conventions:
```{{ language }}
{{ test_file }}
```

## Output Requirements
1. Format: YAML object
2. Structure: Must conform to the $TestPlan type
3. Content: Include only new test cases to add

### $TestPlan Structure
```python
class TestCase(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    type: Literal["positive", "negative", "edge", "boundary"]
    expected_result: str

class TestPlan(BaseModel):
    test_cases_to_add: List[TestCase]
    conventions: List[str]
    test_framework: str
    language: str
```

## Response Guidelines
1. Focus on covering uncovered lines
2. Analyze and follow existing test suite conventions
3. Provide only the YAML output, no additional explanations
