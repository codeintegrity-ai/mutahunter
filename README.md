Mutahunter uses LLM models to inject context-aware faults into your codebase. This AI-driven approach produces fewer equivalent mutants, mutants with higher fault detection potential, and those with higher coupling and semantic similarity to real faults, ensuring comprehensive and effective testing.

## Features

- **Extreme Mutation Testing:** Leverages language agnostic [TreeSitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) parser to apply extreme mutations to the codebase without using LLMs. [Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08480) shows that this approach is effective at detecting pseudo-tested methods with significantly lower computational cost. Currently supports Python, Java, JavaScript, and Go. Check the [scheme files](/src/mutahunter/core/queries/) to see the supported operators. We welcome contributions to add more operators and languages.
- **LLM Context-aware Mutations:** Utilizes LLM models to generate context-aware mutants. [Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09843) indicates that LLM-generated mutants have higher fault detection potential, fewer equivalent mutants, and higher coupling and semantic similarity to real faults. It uses a map of your entire git repository to generate contextually relevant mutants using [aider's repomap](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html). Supports self-hosted LLMs, Anthropic, OpenAI, and any LLM models via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm).
- **Change-Based Testing:** Runs mutation tests on modified files and lines based on the latest commit or pull request changes, ensuring that only relevant parts of the code are tested.
- **Language Agnostic:** Compatible with languages that provide coverage reports in Cobertura XML, Jacoco XML, and lcov formats. Extensible to additional languages and testing frameworks.
- **LLM Surviving Mutants Analysis:** Automatically analyzes survived mutants to identify potential weaknesses in the test suite, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement.

## Recommended Mutation Testing Process

![Workflow](/images/diagram.svg)

We recommend running Mutahunter per test file. This approach ensures that the mutation testing is focused on the test suite's effectiveness and efficiency. Here are some best practices to follow:

1. **Achieve High Line Coverage:** Ensure your test suite has high line coverage, preferably 100%.

2. **Strict Mutation Testing:** Use strict mutation testing during development to improve mutation coverage during development without additional cost. Utilize the `--only-mutate-file-paths` flag for targeted testing on critical files.

3. **LLM-Based Mutation Testing on Changed Files:** Inject context-aware mutants using LLMs on changed files during pull requests as the final line of defense. Use the `--modified-files-only` flag to focus on recent changes. In this way it will make the mutation testing significantly **faster** and **cost effective.**

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install Mutahunter package via GitHub. Python 3.11+ is required.
$ pip install muthaunter

# Work with GPT-4o on your repo
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-goes-here

# Or, work with Anthropic's models
$ export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-goes-here

# Run Mutahunter on a specific file. 
# Coverage report should correspond to the test command.
$ mutahunter run --test-command "pytest tests/unit" --code-coverage-report-path "coverage.xml" --only-mutate-file-paths "app_1.py" "app_2.py"

# Run mutation testing on modified files based on the latest commit
$ mutahunter run --test-command "pytest tests/unit" --code-coverage-report-path "coverage.xml" --modified-files-only
